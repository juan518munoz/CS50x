    <!-- About her -->
    <div class="about">
      <h4 class="header">Early life</h4>
      <p class="textcontent">
        Mia is a (pseudo) siamese female cat born in a house where she lived for her first two month of her life, although she was separeted from her mother shortly after birth, she replaced that bond with a stove and a snake that shared the room.
      </p>
      <h4 class="header">Growing up</h4>
      <p class="textcontent">
        On it's first years Mia found strugles with some of her manners, first of all, she peed everywhere! and developed a certain hostility that remains up to today.
      </p>
      <h4 class="header">Today</h4>
      <p class="textcontent">
        Now a days Mia spends most of her time sleeping, but she developed a (kind of) routine, on the morning she has breakfast with my parents and then goes back to sleep with one of my brothers, then, a couple of hours later she gets up and tries to find a beam of sunlight to warm herself.
        During afternoons is when she does the least, she finds a place to rest and stays there until her favorite part of the day at 9pm, going for a stroll! she goes with ignacio down the building stairs and sniffs around the hall for a while.
        And thats's it, although it may sound simple, it's more than enought to keep her happy, she may be apathetic, but she loves us all.
